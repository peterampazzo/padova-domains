# padova-domains

### About

Scanning things like HTTPS (at the moment). Can be extended to third party service use and web accessibility.
Made possible by [`domain-scan`](https://github.com/18F/domain-scan) developed by 18F.

### Domains 

You can find all the scanned domains in the root of this repo. There're three main lists:

* `govenment.csv` - all the websites managed by the Municipality of Padova, subsidiaries and other public authorities
* `education.csv` - all the educational institutes in the area
* `noprofit.csv` - all the nonprofits placed in the area (the first import was made by the public registy on [padovanet.it](http://www.padovanet.it/noprofit/associazioni_search?search=all)
